## opt template

A generalized template to use with for opt.


Read over the code, some print statements are left for init trouble shooting



This is were the initial usage is pulled in, "__Doc__"


```js
def usage(inData):
    print("\n ", inData)
    print(__Doc__)
```

Mod the text within the 3 back quotes for it to show up as usage.
Also the usage(inData) needs to revert back to usage() after all testing
is done along with a  "#" in front many of the print statements.
